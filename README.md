## Introduction

The motivation for this project came from [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-political-twitter-ce3476a38377) article. I found the results of their analyses to be very interesting and realized the potential of drawing wonderful insights from Twitter data using **Natural Language Processing** and more specifically **Sentiment Analysis.** It is worth mentioning that this project serves as an introduction to NLP for myself, therefore, it is merely exploratory.

## Background

In recent months, we have witnessed the spread of the novel Coronavirus and it's consequences on the routinely lives of people across the world. With travel restrictions, a surge in unemployment rates, and an overburden on hospitals, people looked to their leaders and governments in hopes of handling the unprecedented situation as best as possible. Although, the primary response of most countries has been to implement "social-distancing" and "stay-at-home" policies, President Trump's government has had several stances on dealing with the spread of the virus. In addition, the public's attitude towards the virus as well as the President's response to it, appears to be quite diverse.

Using the [twitterscraper](https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper) module, I collected data from Twitter, with tweets consisting of the keywords: "coronavirus & trump," and time period: Jan-1-2020 to May-1-2020. My aim was to address the following questions:

- Besides the keywords, what are other words that are most frequently found in these tweets?
- How has the overall sentiment (regarding coronavirus & trump) changed over time?
- 

For sentiment analysis, I used the [Vader](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) Sentiment Analysis tools.
